# Manahearth
**A Casual Variant for Magic: the Gathering (Based loosely on Hearthstone)**

Rules

1. The Manahearth Variant uses all of the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.
2. A Manahearth game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game. The default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option. See the Comprehensive Rules 806, “Free-for-All Variant.”
3. Each Manahearth Deck is subject to the following deck construction rules.
  1. A Manahearth Deck must contain at least 1 Planeswalker Card and 30 other cards.
    1. Unlike a normal game of Magic, the number of cards in the deck cannot exceed 31 cards.
  2. Only up to two copies of cards with the same English name are allowed in a Manahearth deck.
  3. Only up to one copy of cards with the Legendary supertype and the same English name are allowed in a Manahearth deck.
  4. Manahearth games may be further modified by formats that limit the cards that are allowed (eg. Standard Manahearth, Modern Manahearth, etc).
4. In addition to normal game materials, up to ten copies of the five basic land cards (Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain and Forest) are placed on the “Manahearth Zone”.
5. Each player’s maximum hand size is 10.
6. At the start of the game, each player puts one Planeswalker card from his or her deck face up into their "Hero Zone". Then each player shuffles the remaining 30 cards of his or her deck so that the cards are in a random order. Those cards become the player’s library.
7. Once the starting player has been determined, each player sets his or her life total to 20 and draws a hand of three cards.
8. Players can take up to one Mulligan in a Manahearth game. If a player takes a Mulligan, then that player may shuffle one, two or all three starting cards back into their library, then draws until they have three starting cards.
9. Players *not* going first are given a “Lotus” Instant Card with the casting cost of zero and the text: “Add one mana of any color to your mana pool then exile this card.”
10. Players going first draws a card during their first draw step.
11. The “Manahearth Rule”: Anytime a player can play a land card from their hand, they may instead play a land card from the Manahearth Zone.
  1. When a land from the Manahearth is put anywhere from the Battlefield, it is returned to the Manahearth Zone instead.
12. When a Player plays a Planeswalker Card from anywhere, the current Planeswalker Card in that player’s Hero Zone is moved into the Graveyard, and the newly played Planeswalker Card is moved into the Hero Zone.
13. In addition to the Comprehensive Rules 306. Planeswalkers, the following rules apply to any Planeswaker Card in the Hero Zone.
  1. There can only be one planeswalker Card in a player’s Hero Zone at any given time.
  2. The planeswalker in the Hero Zone is considered to have Shroud and Indestructible, and cannot switch owners, be sacrificed or be exiled. 
    1. The planeswalker is also not considered when determining effects such as Devotion, since it is not in the Battlefield.
  3. The planeswalker in the Hero Zone is considered to have zero loyalty points.
    1. The planeswalker in the Hero Zone is not destroyed by the state based effect that checks for zero loyalty counters (Comprehensive Rules 306.9).
  4. The “Hero Ability” Rule: Any time an ability from the planeswalker can be played, the player may pay 2 mana of any color and lose life equal to the loyalty cost of the ability as cost in order to activate the ability.
    1. The player always loses life when using the Hero Ability of their planeswalker, even if the loyalty cost is positive.
  5. The “Ultimate Ability” Rule: The planeswalker’s last ability can only be used once per game by paying the planeswalker’s casting cost plus 2 mana of any color and losing life equal to the loyalty cost of the ability as cost in order to activate the ability.
    1. The player always loses life when using the Ultimate Ability of their planeswalker, even if the loyalty cost is positive.
    2. When the player has already used an Ultimate Ability during a game, they can no longer use Ultimate Abilities even if the planeswalker card in the Hero Zone is replaced.
14. The “Mill 30” Rule: If a player is required to draw more cards than are left in his or her library, he or she draws the remaining cards, shuffles his graveyard into his library, and continues to draw cards.
  1. If there are no cards in the player’s graveyard (eg. they are all exiled) and the player is required to draw more cards than are left in his or her library, then he or she draws the remaining cards, and loses the game the next time a player would receive priority.
